This is a basic react application, bootstrapped with the create-react-app CLI command.  

It uses the Open Weather API to generate current weather conditions for a user entered location.
Data is fetched from the API using the XHR module.  

URL to try the application:  https://scotts-react-weather.herokuapp.com/
